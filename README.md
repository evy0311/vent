# Vent ðŸ’­

Vent is an app for iOS that allows users to type whatever it is that they want, and vent. Nobody will ever read it again, not even you. 

### Why? 

I have never done iOS development before, and I'd like to get started. This was a small test project for me to become familiar with Xcode and the Swift programming language. I don't have any intentions on releasing this app to the app store, it is purely for me to start learning iOS development.
